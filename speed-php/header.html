<h2>speed/validity selectors test for frameworks.</h2>
<p>
  Every framework runs in his own <code>IFRAME</code>, thus no conflicts can happen. Tests are run 
  selector by selector, with an interval to prevent the browser from freezing.
</p>
<p>
  Tests are run in a neutral environment against a local copy of 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/">this document</a>, no library or 
  framework is included in the main JavaScript test, to avoid favoritism.
</p>
<p>
  Choose the number of iterations below that each selector will be executed. Since timing in 
  JavaScript is limited to milliseconds, choosing a higher iteration count on faster computers 
  (<strong>ms</strong>=0) gives a more reliable result. The <strong>ms</strong> displayed is for each 
  execution, total time divided by iteration count.
